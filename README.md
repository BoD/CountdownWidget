CountdownWidget
===============

A very simple Android widget that shows the number of days
until the release of these movies: 
- Star Wars Episode VII
- Star Wars: Rogue One
- Star Wars Episode VIII
- Star Wars: Han Solo
- (not a movie?) the next US presidential inaugurations

An Android Wear notification is also included (if enabled, it will be sent to the watch every day at 8am).
